# Guessing-The-Title

This Python project utilizes NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing and data analysis. It aims to predict 
titles based on word frequency analysis.

This project involves text processing and analysis to predict titles from given corpora. It removes stopwords and special
